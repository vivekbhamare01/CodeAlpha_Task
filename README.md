- Handle HTML elements such as tags, classes, and IDs
- Create custom datasets for further analysis
- Store scraped data in a usable format (CSV)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas

## Workflow
1. Send HTTP request to the target website
2. Parse HTML content using BeautifulSoup
3. Identify required data elements
4. Extract and clean the data
5. Save the dataset for analysis

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries  
   `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas`
2. Run the script  
   `python web_scraping.py`

## Output
- Cleaned dataset saved as a CSV file

# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing text data to understand public sentiment.
It classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral categories and detects emotions
using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Objectives
- Classify text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral
- Detect emotions using NLP techniques and sentiment lexicons
- Analyze data from sources such as Amazon reviews, social media, or news articles
- Identify public opinion and sentiment trends
- Use insights to support marketing, product development, or social analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK / TextBlob
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Workflow
1. Collect text data from reviews or online sources
2. Clean and preprocess text (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
3. Apply sentiment analysis techniques
4. Classify sentiments and emotions
5. Visualize sentiment distribution and trends

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries  
   `pip install pandas nltk textblob matplotlib seaborn`
2. Run the script  
   `python sentiment_analysis.py`

## Output
- Sentiment classification results
- Emotion-based insights
- Visual charts showing sentiment trends

## Internship Task
This project was developed as part of an internship to gain hands-on experience in
text analytics, NLP, and understanding real-world public opinion through data.
